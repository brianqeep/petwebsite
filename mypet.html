    <p>Tusker is an Anatolian Shepherd Dog and a breed native of Turkey, where he was developed as a shepherds companion and livestock guardian.</p>
    <p> He was bred to resemble the size and color of the livestock he defended so predators would not detect him among the flock.</p>
    <p>Sometimes called the Anatolian Karabash Dog, he is a fiercely loyal guard dog and a large, impressive dog breed, weighing 120 to 150 pounds at maturity.</p>
